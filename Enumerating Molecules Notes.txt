Graph = (V(G), E(G)) where V(G) are the vertexes and E(G) are the edges
Molecular graphs have edge multiplicity and labeled vertex
Atom valence = vertex degree
bond order = edge multiplicity
The valence sequence of benzene is (6,0,0,6)
Store as nx1 vector for element
nxn ajacency matrix, diagonals are 0, conectivity stack read from upper right to left of upper triangle
